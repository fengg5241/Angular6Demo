Dear All,

Please accept this letter as notice of my resignation from my position. 
My last day of employment will be 24th Aug 2018.

I received an offer to serve as perm postion in other bank, 
and after careful consideration, I realize that this opportunity 
is too exciting for me to decline.

It has been a pleasure working with you and your team over the last one year. 
Your company is poised for continued growth.

I would like to help SCB with the transition of my duties 
so that projects continue to function smoothly after my departure. 
I am available to help recruit and train my replacement, 
and I will make certain that all reporting and records are updated 
before my last day of work.

Eric, Cristina, and Jean thank you again for the opportunity to work for Allegis. 
I wish you all the best and I look forward to staying in touch with you. 
You can email me anytime at dan_5241@126.com or call me at 98508635.

Sincerely,

 

Shan Feng
